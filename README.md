# TBillStakingDashboard

# What is the dashboard?
TBill Staking Dashboard is a community project created by @czmathew _(head developer)_ and Maxime, @TechSherpa _(community manager and idea spitter)_.

The main objective of this Dashboard is to have access at all times to every TBILL data **without** having to connect your wallet.

## How does it work?
First of all, none of your data is stored in our server.

Then, every data is pulled from different websites (TBILL and OpenTheta) and aggregated in the Dashboard.

It's clearer, way more user friendly and everything is in one place.

You have access to the whole source code in here in GitHub to check everything.

Thank you,
Mat and Max!
